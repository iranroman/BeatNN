/Continue writting CNN experiments for beat if from single-trial eeg data
/Write to Sebastian Stober to clarify the following questions:
	1. What do the trigger codes in 'STI 014' indicate? the onset of what?
	2. In condition 1, how can I know the onset of clicks vs the onset of the stimulus?
	3. In 'STI 014', what do the codes '1000', '1111', and '2001' indicate?
	4. On the github repo there are two versions of the audio stimuli (i.e. cues.v1 vs cues.v2, and also full.v1 vs full.v2). What's different between them?
/Clone the github OpenMIIR repository
/Use librosa to detect the onset of beats in the OpenMIIR stimuli and compare with audacity
	Note: due to the loud cue clicks, librosa has a hardtime finding the beats in some of the audio files. Will need to mask the metronome cues to find ALL the beats.
