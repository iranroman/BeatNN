Stober S. Toward studying music cognition with information retrieval techniques: Lessons learned from the OpenMIIR initiative. Frontiers in psychology. 2017 Aug 3;8:1255.
-Significance: overview of the work on music imagery information retrieval (MIIR), carried out between 2015 and 2017, using the OpenMIIR dataset of eeg recordings (Stober et al. 2015). 
-Gives a brief description of the OpenMIIR dataset.
-Describes eeg studies that found rich musical features in eeg recordings when people listen and imagine musical stimuli.
-Three experiments with the OpenMIIR dataset:
	1. erp-inspired single trial analysis
		goal: musical tempo estimation from eeg recordings when listening and imagining musical stimuli.
		methodology: autocorrelation analysis using a sliding window over a single trial of eeg. The sliding autocorrelations get stacked to a matrix, and the location of the max value indicates the estimated tempo (Sternin et al. 2015).
		results: encouraging indication that eeg signals contain musical tempo information.
	2. audio envelope reconstruction
		goal: reconstruct audio envelopes from eeg signals.
		methodology: convolutional filter learning to convolve the eeg singal and produce the reconstructed stimulus envelope (O'Sullivan et al. 2015).
		results: not satisfying. Model was overfit and did not generalize.
	3. finding musical stimuli features in eeg
		goal: identify musical features in the eeg signal that are directly related to the imagination or perception of music. 
		methodology: 1) autoencoder to reduce the noise in the EEG sinal. 2) classification algorithms for stimulus, group, and meter. 
		results: encouraging but very early-stage
