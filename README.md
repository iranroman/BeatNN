## Abstract:
Data-driven sound creation is a central feature of computer music. An EEG-based drum machine will explore the potential for musical rhythm imagery classification to operate a musical device. Interestingly, neural activities during perception and imagery of temporal structures of music also overlap closely with those during motor imagery. Studies have explored the motor imagery task for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications using noninvasive EEG. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can extract features from EEG during motor imagery to control a BCI apparatus in real time. Recently, research has shown that EEG is modulated during music imagery reflecting the speed of musical tempo. Furthermore, CNN-based classification is also successful for EEG during musical rhythm imagery. Thus, our idea is to create an EEG-BCI-based drum machine linked to musical rhythm imagery. We will train CNNs with open-source existing data during musical rhythm imagery tasks to recognize musical features and then incorporate the results into a prototype BCI system. This opens the door to the future BCIs with imagery for other musical features such as pitch, timbre, and harmony.
