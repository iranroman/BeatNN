Jay: Before trying to classify different mental states, start with a simpler task, like classification of pulses with different tempi.
Students:
-Instead of classifying epochs with EEG data right after the beat, classify epochs with EEG data before the beat. That way EEG is more likely to have information about a person's mental state and expectations (top down processes), instead of information about stimulus processing (bottom-up).
-Classify longer epochs, in order to capture more information about what people are listening and processing on a more global scale.
-More care needs to be taken about which baselines for these classification are good frames of reference to compare CCNs with.
